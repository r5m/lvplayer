1
00:00:35,293 --> 00:00:38,729
<i>You're entering the vicinity
of an area adjacent to a location. </i>

2
00:00:38,973 --> 00:00:42,727
<i>A place you might find a monster
or weird mirror. </i>

3
00:00:42,973 --> 00:00:46,124
<i>These are examples. 
It could be much better. </i>

4
00:00:46,373 --> 00:00:49,251
<i>Prepare to enter The Scary Door.</i>

5
00:00:57,573 --> 00:01:02,772
<i>Per your request, please find enclosed
the last man on earth. </i>

6
00:01:03,173 --> 00:01:08,372
Finally, solitude.
I can read books for all eternity.

7
00:01:09,573 --> 00:01:13,168
It's not fair.
It's not fair!

8
00:01:13,413 --> 00:01:18,441
Wait, my eyes aren't that bad.
I can read the large print books.

9
00:01:18,693 --> 00:01:23,892
It's not...!
Well, lucky I can read braille.

10
00:01:27,293 --> 00:01:28,772
Hey, look, a weird mirror.

11
00:01:29,813 --> 00:01:31,644
Cursed by his own hubris.

12
00:01:31,853 --> 00:01:34,367
A debate's on!
Change the channel!

13
00:01:34,573 --> 00:01:37,724
That's what Fry said
when we turned on the debate.

14
00:01:37,933 --> 00:01:41,289
<i>C- Span 9 presents
"The Thrill of Politics. "</i>

15
00:01:46,733 --> 00:01:48,564
There are no car chases...

16
00:01:48,813 --> 00:01:52,692
But one of these men will become
president of the world.

17
00:01:52,893 --> 00:01:54,963
So? We live in the United States.

18
00:01:55,173 --> 00:01:57,164
That's part of the world.

19
00:01:57,373 --> 00:01:59,284
I have been gone a long time.

20
00:01:59,493 --> 00:02:02,769
It's time someone
had the courage to say:

21
00:02:03,013 --> 00:02:05,732
"I'm against things everybody hates. "

22
00:02:05,933 --> 00:02:09,289
I respect my opponent.
He's a good man.

23
00:02:09,493 --> 00:02:13,008
But frankly, I agree with everything
he just said!

24
00:02:13,373 --> 00:02:16,445
These candidates sound like clones.

25
00:02:16,813 --> 00:02:18,531
Wait, they are clones!

26
00:02:18,773 --> 00:02:22,686
Even with identical DNA,
they differ on key issues.

27
00:02:22,893 --> 00:02:26,442
Your three-Cent titanium tax
goes too far!

28
00:02:26,693 --> 00:02:30,766
Your three-Cent titanium tax
doesn't go too far enough!

29
00:02:30,973 --> 00:02:33,771
If I were registered,
I'd send a message...

30
00:02:33,973 --> 00:02:36,567
By staying home on election day,
dressed like a clown.

31
00:02:36,773 --> 00:02:39,731
You're not registered?
Not vaccinated, either.

32
00:02:39,933 --> 00:02:42,527
One vote never made a difference.

33
00:02:42,733 --> 00:02:46,408
The first robot president won
by exactly one vote.

34
00:02:46,613 --> 00:02:48,683
John Quincy Adding Machine.

35
00:02:48,893 --> 00:02:53,171
He enticed voters by pledging
not to go on a killing spree.

36
00:02:53,413 --> 00:02:56,928
But, like most, he promised
more than he could deliver.

37
00:02:57,173 --> 00:02:59,243
One vote can make a difference...

38
00:02:59,493 --> 00:03:02,963
And even though it won't,
you're going to register.

39
00:03:03,173 --> 00:03:07,371
Yes, that's a capital idea!
Let's all go register.

40
00:03:07,613 --> 00:03:09,888
When did you care about voting?

41
00:03:10,093 --> 00:03:12,368
The very instant I became old.

42
00:03:20,013 --> 00:03:23,323
The problem is,
both parties give your tax dollars...

43
00:03:23,533 --> 00:03:25,091
To the less fortunate.

44
00:03:25,293 --> 00:03:26,851
They get all the breaks!

45
00:03:27,093 --> 00:03:29,732
You could join a third party, maybe.

46
00:03:29,933 --> 00:03:32,925
Only weirdos and mutants
join third parties.

47
00:03:33,133 --> 00:03:36,523
I'd better keep an eye out
at the next meeting.

48
00:03:36,733 --> 00:03:39,725
What's your party, Bender?
I can't vote.

49
00:03:39,933 --> 00:03:42,447
Because you're a robot?
No, a felon.

50
00:03:49,453 --> 00:03:53,162
We favor huge subsidies
to the Brain Slug planet.

51
00:03:53,413 --> 00:03:57,201
Okay, but what are the Brain Slugs
gonna do for the working man?

52
00:03:57,413 --> 00:04:00,962
Attach Brain Slugs to them.
Sure, you say that now.

53
00:04:03,053 --> 00:04:06,329
Is it true you can make shirts
and rope out of hemp?

54
00:04:06,573 --> 00:04:08,165
Dave's not here, man.

55
00:04:08,413 --> 00:04:11,325
I heard hemp makes great shampoo.
It does?

56
00:04:11,533 --> 00:04:15,685
No way!
I gotta check out this brochure.

57
00:04:18,413 --> 00:04:23,362
What are you doing to protect my right
to bear doomsday devices?

58
00:04:23,613 --> 00:04:28,448
We'll get rid of the three-Day
waiting period for mad scientists.

59
00:04:28,653 --> 00:04:32,362
Today, the mad scientist can't get
a doomsday device...

60
00:04:32,613 --> 00:04:36,367
Tomorrow, the mad grad student.
Where will it end?

61
00:04:36,573 --> 00:04:40,327
Amen! I don't go anywhere
without my mutated anthrax...

62
00:04:40,573 --> 00:04:41,892
For duck hunting.

63
00:04:42,493 --> 00:04:44,131
Sure, humans are cute...

64
00:04:44,333 --> 00:04:46,642
But how will we test cosmetics?

65
00:04:46,893 --> 00:04:48,087
I concur.

66
00:04:49,653 --> 00:04:52,372
Here's a party to get excited about.
Sign me up.

67
00:04:52,573 --> 00:04:54,484
Not with that attitude.

68
00:04:54,693 --> 00:04:57,526
Okay, screw it.
Welcome aboard, brother!

69
00:04:57,733 --> 00:04:59,485
All right!
You're out.

70
00:05:02,853 --> 00:05:06,050
I'm actually getting interested
in politics.

71
00:05:12,653 --> 00:05:15,770
<i>With two weeks left, 
the question is... </i>

72
00:05:15,973 --> 00:05:19,329
<i>Who will be
the next president of Earth? </i>

73
00:05:19,533 --> 00:05:23,128
<i>Jack Johnson, 
or bitter rival, John Jackson? </i>

74
00:05:23,373 --> 00:05:25,603
<i>Terrific candidates, huh, Morbo? </i>

75
00:05:25,813 --> 00:05:29,089
<i>All humans are vermin
in the eyes of Morbo. </i>

76
00:05:32,133 --> 00:05:35,409
<i>Disaster struck
on Saturn 's moon, Titan... </i>

77
00:05:35,613 --> 00:05:39,811
<i>When a titanium mine collapsed, 
trapping 1 000 robot workers. </i>

78
00:05:41,013 --> 00:05:42,002
Good lord!

79
00:05:42,213 --> 00:05:46,570
<i>Without a quick response, 
the robots will die within 300 years. </i>

80
00:05:46,973 --> 00:05:49,533
<i>What rescue operations are planned? </i>

81
00:05:50,933 --> 00:05:54,130
<i>We'll pave over the area, 
then move on. </i>

82
00:05:55,373 --> 00:05:58,729
<i>The news sent
titanium prices skyrocketing. </i>

83
00:05:58,933 --> 00:06:01,003
I'm rich!
What do you mean?

84
00:06:01,213 --> 00:06:03,408
My body's 40 percent titanium.

85
00:06:03,613 --> 00:06:06,844
I'm finally richer than those
snooty ATMs.

86
00:06:07,053 --> 00:06:10,170
Too bad you can't spend it.
Oh, can't I?

87
00:06:10,373 --> 00:06:12,841
No.
Watch me, poor man.

88
00:06:14,093 --> 00:06:16,527
Pleasure doing business with you.

89
00:06:18,133 --> 00:06:21,330
Game's over, losers.
I have all the money.

90
00:06:21,533 --> 00:06:25,765
Compare your lives to mine,
and then kill yourselves.

91
00:06:26,013 --> 00:06:27,969
Hey, get away!

92
00:06:28,213 --> 00:06:32,126
You get five dollars to not do
what you're thinking about.

93
00:06:34,573 --> 00:06:37,041
You just lost five dollars.

94
00:06:41,693 --> 00:06:43,763
Hey, buddy, little help?

95
00:06:44,013 --> 00:06:45,605
Thank you!

96
00:06:48,893 --> 00:06:50,246
Hello, peasants.

97
00:06:50,493 --> 00:06:51,972
What happened to you?

98
00:06:52,213 --> 00:06:54,169
Yeah, did you get a haircut?

99
00:06:54,373 --> 00:06:57,012
No, I sold my body!

100
00:06:57,293 --> 00:07:01,127
Sold your body?
Bender, I've been down that road.

101
00:07:01,373 --> 00:07:03,933
It's glamorous,
the parties are great...

102
00:07:04,133 --> 00:07:08,331
But you'll spend every dollar
on jewelry and skintight pants.

103
00:07:08,533 --> 00:07:11,764
How are you gonna live without a body?

104
00:07:12,013 --> 00:07:14,732
Bodies are for hookers and fat people.

105
00:07:14,933 --> 00:07:17,527
All I need is a wad of
cash with a head.

106
00:07:17,733 --> 00:07:22,932
Now you can pay off your loan shark.
What's he gonna do, break my legs?

107
00:07:24,813 --> 00:07:26,565
This is the life.

108
00:07:26,813 --> 00:07:29,771
Another martini, please?

109
00:07:31,533 --> 00:07:34,286
Shaken, not stirred.

110
00:07:35,413 --> 00:07:36,732
Yeah!

111
00:07:39,733 --> 00:07:41,928
Put it all on black.

112
00:07:43,453 --> 00:07:46,172
Ooh! Ah! Ouch! Oh!

113
00:07:48,413 --> 00:07:50,563
21 red.

114
00:07:50,813 --> 00:07:53,122
I beg your pardon, 33 black.

115
00:07:53,333 --> 00:07:55,847
Yes!
The rich get richer!

116
00:08:06,773 --> 00:08:10,129
Strike!
In your face, Leela!

117
00:08:13,333 --> 00:08:14,322
Ow!

118
00:08:27,013 --> 00:08:29,322
Timber!

119
00:08:30,333 --> 00:08:32,369
Can I ride in your car?

120
00:08:32,613 --> 00:08:36,003
No, it looks like your neck stepped
in something.

121
00:08:36,693 --> 00:08:40,527
Oh, I'm sorry, that's just your body.

122
00:08:42,013 --> 00:08:44,368
Look me in the shins and say that!

123
00:08:44,653 --> 00:08:47,121
I've had it up to here
with this place.

124
00:08:47,333 --> 00:08:52,612
I'm off to hang out with classy heads
like me, who appreciate...

125
00:08:52,893 --> 00:08:55,248
Poetry, philosophy, hats.

126
00:08:55,533 --> 00:08:58,331
So long, coffin stuffers!

127
00:09:05,293 --> 00:09:08,012
Could one of you coffin stuffers
please carry me?

128
00:09:18,213 --> 00:09:21,364
Which group of heads is good enough
for me?

129
00:09:21,613 --> 00:09:24,002
What do you think, Fry? Fry?

130
00:09:25,133 --> 00:09:27,328
Hi, I'm Claudia Schiffer's head.

131
00:09:27,613 --> 00:09:30,525
I recognize you.
Didn't you have a body?

132
00:09:30,773 --> 00:09:32,729
Yeah, but it was holding me back.

133
00:09:33,013 --> 00:09:37,768
<i>I just did the cover of
the Sports Illustrated Swim Cap Issue.</i>

134
00:09:38,013 --> 00:09:39,526
Well, you're looking great.

135
00:09:39,813 --> 00:09:43,647
I'd like to lose a few pounds.
Couldn't hurt.

136
00:09:46,373 --> 00:09:48,841
Ah, U.S. Presidents.

137
00:09:49,093 --> 00:09:52,324
Sturdy shelves, good security.

138
00:09:52,893 --> 00:09:54,372
This place has class.

139
00:09:54,613 --> 00:09:59,050
Hi, sugar. Legally, nothing I can do
counts as sex anymore.

140
00:09:59,293 --> 00:10:03,605
I apologize. He gets this way
around meaty-Iooking women.

141
00:10:04,013 --> 00:10:06,846
I remember you.
I was gonna vote for you.

142
00:10:07,093 --> 00:10:10,563
But voting isn't cool,
so I got trashed on Listerine.

143
00:10:10,853 --> 00:10:14,243
I've never felt voting is essential
to the process.

144
00:10:14,493 --> 00:10:16,563
No kidding, Ford.

145
00:10:16,853 --> 00:10:20,528
So the hooker-Bot says,
"That's not my expansion slot"...

146
00:10:20,733 --> 00:10:25,568
And my friend says,
"That's not my 25-Pin connector! "

147
00:10:27,573 --> 00:10:31,122
Bender, thou robots
really cracketh me up.

148
00:10:31,373 --> 00:10:34,729
I like it here.
What's the rent for a jar?

149
00:10:35,013 --> 00:10:38,722
Sorry, we can't let every
Tom, Dick and Harry move in.

150
00:10:38,933 --> 00:10:41,527
No offense,
Jefferson, Nixon and Truman.

151
00:10:41,813 --> 00:10:44,964
How about the closet
of presidential losers?

152
00:10:45,573 --> 00:10:49,202
Bob Dole needs company.
LaRouche won't stop telling jokes.

153
00:10:49,533 --> 00:10:52,764
Pass.
What hath happened to your body?

154
00:10:53,013 --> 00:10:55,732
I hocked it.
Why wouldst thou do that?

155
00:10:56,013 --> 00:10:59,892
Same reason you hocked your teeth.
Ah, booze money.

156
00:11:00,173 --> 00:11:01,492
I remember my body:

157
00:11:01,773 --> 00:11:05,527
Flabby, pasty-Skinned,
riddled with phlebitis.

158
00:11:05,773 --> 00:11:08,606
A good Republican body.
God, I loved it.

159
00:11:08,893 --> 00:11:14,047
I spent my teen years loving my body.
Of course, it was tough love...

160
00:11:14,333 --> 00:11:19,123
He opened relations with China.
He doesn't care about your ding-Dong.

161
00:11:19,413 --> 00:11:23,372
Even if you miss your body,
being a head's great too?

162
00:11:23,653 --> 00:11:26,645
No, son.
It's a sad and Ionely life.

163
00:11:26,933 --> 00:11:28,651
Great!
Now you tell me.

164
00:11:28,933 --> 00:11:32,130
That's my style.
Kick them when they're down.

165
00:11:40,093 --> 00:11:42,766
Ones, zeros...

166
00:11:43,013 --> 00:11:45,846
One, one, zero, zero, one...

167
00:11:47,733 --> 00:11:50,566
Bender, what is it?
What an awful dream.

168
00:11:50,813 --> 00:11:55,250
Ones and zeros everywhere!
And I thought I saw a two.

169
00:11:55,493 --> 00:11:58,485
It was just a dream.
There are no twos.

170
00:11:58,733 --> 00:12:03,887
I know what's wrong. My body loved me,
and I turned its back on it.

171
00:12:04,133 --> 00:12:09,287
Well, old friend, tie a yellow ribbon
round your neck. I'm coming home!

172
00:12:10,493 --> 00:12:12,848
You sold my body!
To who?

173
00:12:13,053 --> 00:12:18,127
I can't reveal that.
But I'll give you $50 for the kid.

174
00:12:18,413 --> 00:12:21,564
My clothes are worth 50 bucks.
Deal.

175
00:12:24,333 --> 00:12:29,361
How could I let this happen?
I can't go through life like this!

176
00:12:29,653 --> 00:12:34,807
What about your self-Destruct button?
It's on my body!

177
00:12:35,293 --> 00:12:38,330
What am I gonna do?

178
00:12:40,413 --> 00:12:45,009
I can't stand to see a robot cry.
Let's watch TV.

179
00:12:45,293 --> 00:12:50,128
And so, ladies and gentlemen,
I'm throwing my head into the ring.

180
00:12:50,333 --> 00:12:54,326
I'm announcing my candidacy
for the Presidency of Earth!

181
00:12:55,613 --> 00:12:57,524
Sir, the Constitution states...

182
00:12:57,733 --> 00:13:01,169
Nobody can be elected president
more than twice.

183
00:13:01,453 --> 00:13:03,364
That's right, no "body. "

184
00:13:03,613 --> 00:13:08,323
But, as you can plainly see,
I've got a shiny new body.

185
00:13:11,493 --> 00:13:13,370
Bender, he's got your body!

186
00:13:13,613 --> 00:13:18,562
That double-Crossing bastard!
How dare he run off with Nixon!

187
00:13:21,613 --> 00:13:25,765
He must have bought your body.
And that electric guitar.

188
00:13:25,973 --> 00:13:28,089
<i>Remember</i>

189
00:13:28,253 --> 00:13:32,963
<i>What the Doormouse said</i>

190
00:13:33,133 --> 00:13:35,363
<i>Feed your head</i>

191
00:13:35,573 --> 00:13:38,610
I'm meeting you halfway,
you stupid hippies.

192
00:13:41,413 --> 00:13:43,165
I am not a crook's head.

193
00:13:43,453 --> 00:13:45,648
Yeah, you are!
You stole my body.

194
00:13:45,893 --> 00:13:48,248
Fry, Leela, you gotta help me.

195
00:13:48,533 --> 00:13:53,049
Ordinarily I'd say no, and how
it's your fault for being an idiot.

196
00:13:53,293 --> 00:13:57,525
But when a robotic Nixon is loose,
we have to take action!

197
00:13:57,733 --> 00:13:58,722
Idiot.

198
00:14:11,933 --> 00:14:14,493
Morbo will introduce the candidates.

199
00:14:14,773 --> 00:14:16,968
Puny human number one.

200
00:14:17,213 --> 00:14:19,169
Puny human number two.

201
00:14:19,413 --> 00:14:21,643
And my good friend, Richard Nixon.

202
00:14:21,893 --> 00:14:24,088
Hello, Morbo.
How's the family?

203
00:14:24,413 --> 00:14:26,210
Belligerent and numerous.

204
00:14:26,533 --> 00:14:30,924
Good man.
Nixon's pro-War and pro-Family.

205
00:14:33,933 --> 00:14:37,528
First he steals my body,
now he's touching my stuff.

206
00:14:37,733 --> 00:14:40,406
We've got to find a way
to talk to him.

207
00:14:42,613 --> 00:14:45,969
Morbo demands an answer
to the following question:

208
00:14:46,213 --> 00:14:49,762
If you saw candy in the hands
of a small child...

209
00:14:50,013 --> 00:14:51,844
Would you seize and eat it?

210
00:14:52,173 --> 00:14:53,128
Unthinkable!

211
00:14:53,333 --> 00:14:54,527
Wouldn't think it!

212
00:14:54,733 --> 00:14:59,170
What about you, Mr. Nixon?
You are under a truth-O-Scope.

213
00:15:00,533 --> 00:15:04,003
Uh, well, l, uh... .
The question is vague.

214
00:15:04,213 --> 00:15:09,412
You don't say what kind of candy,
whether anyone is watching... .

215
00:15:11,573 --> 00:15:14,531
I certainly wouldn't harm the child.

216
00:15:20,013 --> 00:15:21,651
You scored big points.

217
00:15:21,933 --> 00:15:25,164
What?
They ate me alive out there.

218
00:15:25,453 --> 00:15:30,368
But your body's message was,
"Look at my shiny new body. "

219
00:15:30,613 --> 00:15:34,128
You've got real charisma
from the neck down.

220
00:15:34,333 --> 00:15:35,766
Nixon with charisma?

221
00:15:36,013 --> 00:15:40,131
My God, I can rule the universe!

222
00:15:40,933 --> 00:15:43,208
Give my body back, you thief!

223
00:15:43,413 --> 00:15:47,372
Look here, you drugged-Out communist.
I paid for this body

224
00:15:47,613 --> 00:15:51,322
And I'd no sooner return it
than I would my dog.

225
00:15:52,373 --> 00:15:53,328
Shut up!

226
00:15:53,613 --> 00:15:57,322
Please, we're appealing
to your sense of decency.

227
00:16:02,613 --> 00:16:05,650
Seriously, I'm never giving back
this body.

228
00:16:05,853 --> 00:16:08,367
Beat it! Or I'll get Cambodian
on your asses!

229
00:16:12,493 --> 00:16:17,521
It's hopeless. We might as well turn
in my head for the five-Cent deposit.

230
00:16:17,733 --> 00:16:20,725
My best friend's not getting recycled!

231
00:16:20,973 --> 00:16:23,407
Not for five cents,
not for 500 cents.

232
00:16:23,693 --> 00:16:26,207
I have a plan.
I have a better plan.

233
00:16:34,333 --> 00:16:36,244
Why would Nixon stay here?

234
00:16:36,493 --> 00:16:39,724
You get a discount
if you've been here before.

235
00:16:51,613 --> 00:16:54,332
Keep going. We're right behind you.

236
00:16:55,213 --> 00:16:57,773
Whoa, mama.
Get a room, you two!

237
00:16:58,013 --> 00:17:01,164
We're in a room!
- Then lose some weight!

238
00:17:07,933 --> 00:17:12,723
Oh, yeah. You women's libbers
really know how to party.

239
00:17:13,213 --> 00:17:14,328
Pssst. There I am.

240
00:17:19,133 --> 00:17:24,127
Hey, Betty Friedan,
send a little of that lotion my way.

241
00:17:24,413 --> 00:17:26,369
Okay. Almost got it.

242
00:17:26,613 --> 00:17:31,528
Steady. Steady.
Don't panic.

243
00:17:32,213 --> 00:17:33,692
Oooh!

244
00:17:34,333 --> 00:17:35,766
Uh-Oh.

245
00:17:39,053 --> 00:17:40,884
What the...

246
00:17:43,253 --> 00:17:47,451
You shaggy peaceniks have some nerve.
I want what's mine!

247
00:17:47,733 --> 00:17:51,885
Don't make me kick your neck.
Bring it on, soup can.

248
00:17:56,173 --> 00:17:57,652
Break it up, you two!

249
00:17:59,813 --> 00:18:01,929
That's it!
You're going to jail!

250
00:18:02,133 --> 00:18:05,489
And I don't grant pardons
like that sissy, Ford.

251
00:18:05,773 --> 00:18:09,527
You won't pardon anyone,
because you won't get elected.

252
00:18:09,813 --> 00:18:13,089
The voters aren't pea-Brained
idiots anymore.

253
00:18:13,373 --> 00:18:15,170
No? Listen here, missy.

254
00:18:15,453 --> 00:18:18,923
Computers may be twice as fast
as they were in 1 973...

255
00:18:19,173 --> 00:18:22,131
But voters are as drunk
and stupid as ever!

256
00:18:22,413 --> 00:18:28,329
The only one who's changed is me.
I've become bitter and crazy.

257
00:18:28,533 --> 00:18:33,561
Once I'm in office, I'll sell our
children's organs to zoos for meat!

258
00:18:33,813 --> 00:18:38,125
I'll go into people's houses at
night and wreck up the place!

259
00:18:39,893 --> 00:18:41,292
He lost my vote.

260
00:18:41,573 --> 00:18:43,928
One vote won't make a difference.

261
00:18:44,173 --> 00:18:49,372
Excuse me, while I inch myself over
to the phone and call the police.

262
00:18:51,333 --> 00:18:55,246
Not so fast, Nixon!
Are you familiar with audio tape?

263
00:18:57,613 --> 00:19:00,047
Uh-Oh.
I don't like where this is heading.

264
00:19:00,333 --> 00:19:04,724
<i>I'll go into people's houses at
night and wreck up the place! </i>

265
00:19:06,133 --> 00:19:08,169
I really sound like that?

266
00:19:08,413 --> 00:19:11,086
I thought I had a Clark Gable quality.

267
00:19:12,613 --> 00:19:15,286
We'll trade you the tape
for the body.

268
00:19:15,573 --> 00:19:19,088
Oh, expletive deleted!
You've got a deal.

269
00:19:19,373 --> 00:19:21,933
Hey, I've got one last thought.

270
00:19:28,333 --> 00:19:31,166
It's good to be back
in one piece again...

271
00:19:31,413 --> 00:19:34,485
Except for these damn
bumper stickers.

272
00:19:34,773 --> 00:19:39,528
<i>The sheer drama has driven turnout
to its highest level in centuries... </i>

273
00:19:39,773 --> 00:19:40,762
<i>Six percent! </i>

274
00:19:41,013 --> 00:19:43,766
<i>Exit polls show evil underdog
Richard Nixon... </i>

275
00:19:44,013 --> 00:19:46,208
<i>Trailing with zero votes. </i>

276
00:19:46,493 --> 00:19:48,370
Yes, the system works!

277
00:19:48,653 --> 00:19:52,168
<i>The time is 7:59,
and the robot polls are opening. </i>

278
00:19:52,413 --> 00:19:54,927
<i>The robot vote is in. 
Nixon has won! </i>

279
00:19:55,293 --> 00:19:56,567
No!
Get out of town!

280
00:19:56,773 --> 00:20:00,129
Why'd they vote for him,
now that he's just a head?

281
00:20:01,853 --> 00:20:05,528
I give you the next
president of Earth!

282
00:20:09,573 --> 00:20:11,165
Nixon's back!

283
00:20:14,013 --> 00:20:17,050
I can't believe it.
He won by a single vote.

284
00:20:17,293 --> 00:20:20,444
It ain't my fault.
I'm a non-Voting felon.

285
00:20:20,733 --> 00:20:23,167
It's not my fault.
I forgot to vote.

286
00:20:23,413 --> 00:20:26,689
Crud, I knew there was something
I meant to do today.

287
00:20:26,973 --> 00:20:30,932
<i>Morbo congratulates
our gargantuan cyborg president. </i>

288
00:20:31,173 --> 00:20:34,927
<i>May death come quickly
to his enemies. </i>

289
00:20:42,613 --> 00:20:46,526
Who's kicking who around now?

290
00:20:54,173 --> 00:20:55,925
Knock knock.
